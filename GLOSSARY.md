# Glossary

## macOS Menu Bar
The [macOS Menu Bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_bar#Macintosh) is a strip of menu items that appears at the top of your screen at all times. In Flume, the items in this menu will adapt based off your current [keyboard selection](/misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md) and view.

## Contextual Menu
A [contextual menu](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/ContextualMenus.html) provides convenient access to frequently used commands associated with an item. From the userâ€™s perspective, a contextual menu is a shortcut to a small set of commands that make sense in the context of the current task. If you have a two-buttoned mouse or trackpad, the contextual menu appears when using the right-mouse button. It is also possible to open contextual menus on macOS by holding down the <kbd>^ (CTRL)</kbd> key and clicking with the left-mouse button.

## Title Bar
The macOS title bar is the area at the top of every window in macOS. Flume's title bar is dynamic, and adjusts based on the current content that you are viewing. Common actions related to the view are available in this area.

By default, Flume's title bar hides automatically in the [Feed](/views/feed.md) and [Likes](/views/likes.md) views. You can adjust this behaviour in [Design Preferences.](/preferences/design.md)
