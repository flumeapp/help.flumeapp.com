# Reset Flume

If you are looking to remove Flume of all your account information, simply logout of an account, or [remove it](../preferences/accounts.md). This will remove any traces of your account information from Flume's local database and storage.

If you wish to completely reset Flume, including resetting all [Preferences](../preferences/preferences.md), [Flume Pro](../preferences/flumepro.md) status, caches and account information, hold down the `‚å• (OPTION)` key as soon as you launch Flume. You will be asked to confirm that you wish to reset Flume.
