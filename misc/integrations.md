# Integrations

### Finder

##### System Services

Flume supports macOS Services menu, allow you to right-click any photo/video in Finder and begin the upload process.

See [this article](http://www.macworld.com/article/1163996/software-utilities/how-to-use-services-in-mac-os-x.html) for an introduction to macOS System Services.

##### "Open with…"

Flume also supports opening images and videos directly, though in most instances the default application for opening these files would be Preview. To open an image or video with Flume, right-click on it and use the "Open with…" menu item.

If Flume is not currently open, it will open and present you with an [Upload](/views/upload.md) window with the selected file/s ready to post.

##### Drag to Dock

Flume handles photos and videos dragged to its Dock icon. Each file will open a separate [Upload](/views/upload.md) window.

### Photos

Starting with macOS Yosemite 10.10.3, Apple ships all Macs with [Photos](https://support.apple.com/photos) (the successor to iPhoto). Flume does not currently support [Sharing Extensions](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18826) or [Photo Editor Extensions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205245).

We recommend the use of a third-party extension, [External Editors for Photos](http://externaleditorsforphotos.tumblr.com). This extension will allow you to open any content from [Photos](https://support.apple.com/photos) directly into Flume, as it will be considered an "editor". 

### Lightroom

To send content from Lightroom into Flume, you can create a new Export Preset with the the following options. The only necessary step is that listed under "Post-Processing", the options for where to place the exported file are customizable to your workflow.
