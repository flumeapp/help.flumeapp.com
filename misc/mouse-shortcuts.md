# Mouse Shortcuts

Flume offers some unique mouse-shortcuts to speed up and improve your browsing experience.

## General Shortcuts

| Mouse Combination  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Two-finger swipe | In Column-View mode, a two-finger swipe forward will "push" you to the relevant content as if you clicked on it. The opposite direction two-finger swipe will "pop" you back. The direction adheres to your current scrolling settings as configured in System Preferences > Mouse/Trackpad > Scrolling > Scroll direction.<br /><br />While in the process of making a two-finger swipe, arrow indicators will appear in the Flume main window indicating the direction you are about to move in. |
| Long-press (left-mouse) | Long-press can be used to quickly enlarge media wherever you see it (Feed, Likes, Explore, Profile, Activity).<br /><br />Long-pressing on a hashtag, location or avatar displays previews of that content also. |
