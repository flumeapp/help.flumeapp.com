# Touch Bar

The [Touch Bar](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207055) is a unique hardware-feature that displays a digital strip of controls above the keyboard on select MacBook Pro models.

Flume has comprehensive support for the Touch Bar, localized into all supported languages.



#### Customizing the Touch Bar items

Each "view" in Flume will update the options and buttons available in the Touch Bar. To customize the ordering, or to remove default items, use the <kbd>View > Customize Touch Barâ€¦</kbd> menu bar item.
