<td>UP / DOWN (&uarr; / &darr;)</td>
<td>In Column-View mode, this will &quot;focus&quot; your media selection. In Grid-View Mode, this will move your current selection one row up/down.<br />
<br />
In lists, such as Conversations, or Comments, this will &quot;focus&quot; your selection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LEFT / RIGHT (&larr; / &rarr;)</td>
<td>The behaviour of the Left arrow will depend on your current navigation history. Normally, it will &quot;pop&quot; you one level back to where you previously where. If you have already made a selection in Grid-View Mode, the selection will move one to the left. If you deselect (using ESC), then pressing left will &quot;pop&quot; you back as usual.<br />
<br />
The Right Arrow is only used in Grid-View mode currently, and moves your selection one item to the right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>If you have made a selection using the arrow keys, ESC will deselect your selection.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have no current selection, ESC will &quot;pop&quot; you one level back to where you previously where, if applicable. The window will &quot;bounce&quot; when you cannot &quot;pop&quot; any further.<br />
<br />
If the &quot;Larger Preview&quot; window is visible, ESC will close the Larger Preview, but keep your current selection.<br />
<br />
In &quot;pop-up&quot; windows and popovers, such as the in-built Browser window, Camera window, Upload Locations, &quot;Go to User...&quot; popover, as well as the automatic hashtag and user search popovers, ESC will close the window/popover.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TAB (⇥)</td>
<td>In the Explore, Search and Profile views, the TAB key will switch between the sections of that view. In area where a text-entry area exists, TAB will switch focus between elements in that view (for example, between the Search field and the search results table in the Search view.</td>

## Menu&nbsp;Shortcuts

An inbuilt-feature of macOS are keyboard shortcuts assigned to items in menu&#39;s. Flume shows menu&#39;s when the selection / item makes most sense. For instance, when you are viewing the Profile of a user, the &quot;User&quot; menu will appear in the menu. Similarly, when using keyboard selections for Media, Comments, Conversations and Messages, their related menu&#39;s will appear.
