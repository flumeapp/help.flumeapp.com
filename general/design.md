# Design

The saying goes that a picture is worth a thousand words, and one of Flume's unique features is its standout layout and design, presenting content by default edge-to-edge, with no visible menu bar or title area.

Flume lets you also customize your viewing preferences to your own preferences. Learn more in [Design Preferences.](../preferences/design.md)
