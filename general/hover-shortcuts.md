# Hover Shortcuts

One of Flume's unique features, is something we like to call "Hover Shortcuts". These allow incredibly fast exploration of Instagram, by allowing you to perform actions using both hands - one on the keyboard, and the other on a mouse or trackpad.

To activate a Hover Shortcut, simply mouse the mouse cursor over a post (in either Column-View or Grid-View modes), and press one of the following keys:

| Keyboard Combination  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| L | Likes the media that is directly underneath the mouse cursor. |
| C | Displays a comment text area for the media that is directly underneath the mouse cursor.  |
| S | Saves the media that is directly underneath the mouse cursor.  |
| Space | Opens a large preview for the media that is directly underneath the mouse cursor.  |

## Demo

The demo below demonstrates the use of the "L" shortcut being used to like multiple items quickly while moving the mouse.
