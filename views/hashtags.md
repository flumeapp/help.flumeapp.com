Hashtag previews are a way to quickly inspect the recent media tagged with that hashtag without leaving your current view. These are similar to the long-press actions or 3D Touch behaviours found on the mobile Instagram apps.

To view a hashtag preview:

- Long-press on any hashtag found in a [caption](//views/detailview.md), [comment](//views/detailview.md#comments) or [message.](//views/conversations/messages.md)

To close a hashtag preview, press the <kbd>⎋ (ESC)</kbd> key, or click outside of the preview.
