# Likes

The likes view displays all your previously liked photos and videos. Visually, it behaves identically to that of the [feed](feed.md) view. To view items you have saved, see [profile.](profile/#saved-items)

Your likes view is [limited](../misc/limits.md) to the 300 most recent likes you have made.

{% hint style="info" %}
As of [version 2.8.5.2](../general/whatsnew.md#2-8-5-2), the likes view is no longer enabled by default in the Flume main menu and can be instead accessed via the [profile settings](profile/settings/) menu. You can enable it in the main menu via the [menu Preferences.](../preferences/menu/)
{% endhint %}
