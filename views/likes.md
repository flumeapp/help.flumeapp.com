# Likes

The Likes tab displays all your previous liked photos and videos. Visually, it behaves identically to that of the [Feed](feed.md) view. To view items you have saved, see [Profile.](profile/#saved-items)

Your Likes tab is [limited](../misc/limits.md) to the 300 most recent likes you have made.

{% hint style="info" %}
As of [version 2.8.5.2](../general/whatsnew.md#2-8-5-2), the Likes tab is no longer enabled by default in the Flume main menu and can be instead accessed via the [Profile settings](profile/settings/) menu. You can enable it in the main menu via the [Menu Preferences.](../preferences/menu/)
{% endhint %}
