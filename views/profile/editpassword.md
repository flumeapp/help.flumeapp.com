### Changing Your Password

To change your password:

- When viewing your [Profile](/views/profile.md), select the <kbd>Change Passwordâ€¦</kbd> item under the [Settings](/views/profile/settings.md) <img src="/views/assets/settings.png" width="20" height="20" /> button in the title bar.

> **[info]**
> Changing your password will invalidate your logged in sessions elsewhere, such as the Instagram mobile apps or the website. If you change your password via a method other than Flume, the next time Flume connects to Instagram with your account, you will receive a "Session Timed Out" notice and be logged out.
