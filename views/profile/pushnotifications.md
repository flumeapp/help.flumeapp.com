#### Adjusting Push Notification Settings

To adjust your Push Notification settings:

>**[info]**
> If a Push Notification type is enabled, you will be alerted via the notification settings you have configured in [Notification Preferences.](//preferences/notifications.md) For example, if you have set [New Activity](//preferences/notifications.md#new-activity) notifications to <kbd>None</kbd>, you will not be alerted by means of Desktop Notification or audio alert when a Push Notification is received.
