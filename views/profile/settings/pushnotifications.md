![](../../../.gitbook/assets/profile-pushnotifications%20%281%29.png)

You can customise which types of [Push Notifications](../../../preferences/notifications.md) you would like to receive when Flume is not running.

### Adjusting Push Notification Settings

To adjust your Push Notification settings:

* When viewing your [Profile](../), select the `Push Notification Settings` item under the [Settings](./) ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/settings.png) button in the [title bar.](../../../misc/glossary.md#title-bar)

{% hint style="info" %}
If a Push Notification type is enabled, you will be alerted via the notification settings you have configured in [Notification Preferences.](../../../preferences/notifications.md) For example, if you have set [New Activity](../../../preferences/notifications.md#new-activity) notifications to None, you will not be alerted by means of Desktop Notification or audio alert when a Push Notification is received.
{% endhint %}
