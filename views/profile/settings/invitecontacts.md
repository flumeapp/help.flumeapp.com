# Find Contacts

When you connect Instagram with your Mac's address book, you'll be able to see a list of your contacts who are on Instagram. You can choose contacts to follow from this list. When your address book is connected, it's periodically synced and securely stored on Instagram's servers. You can disconnect your address book at any time.
