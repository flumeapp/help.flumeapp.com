# Favorites

Flume provides complete support for viewing and sharing with your Favorites, otherwise known as "Close Friends".

Posts that are only visible by Favorites are indicated by a `Close Friends` label.

Favorites is currently being tested by Instagram and is not yet available on all accounts. As a result, you may not find the features described below. Flume will automatically enable the features when Instagram rolls the feature out to your account.
