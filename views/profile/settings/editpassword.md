## Changing Your Password

To change your password:

* When viewing your own [profile](../), select the `Passwordâ€¦` item under the [settings](./) ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/settings.png) button in the [title bar.](../../../misc/glossary.md#title-bar)

{% hint style="info" %}
Changing your password will invalidate your logged in sessions elsewhere, such as the Instagram mobile apps or the website. If you change your password via a method other than Flume, the next time Flume connects to Instagram with your account, you will receive a `Session Timed Out` alert and be logged out.
{% endhint %}
