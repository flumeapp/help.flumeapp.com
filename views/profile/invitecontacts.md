# Find Contacts

When you connect Instagram with your Mac's contact list, you'll be able to see a list of your contacts who are on Instagram. You can choose contacts to follow from this list. When your contact list is connected, it's periodically synced and securely stored on Instagram's servers. You can disconnect your contacts at any time.
