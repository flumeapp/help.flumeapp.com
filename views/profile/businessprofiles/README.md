# Business Profiles

A business profile on Instagram will help your customers connect to your business. When converting to a business profile, you'll be able to include additional information about your business on your profile. For example, you'll be able to add a phone number, an email address and your business's physical address. Keep in mind that you must include at least 1 contact option.

When you add contact information, people will see contact options on your [profile](../) like `Get Directions`, `Call` and `Email`, depending on the contact information you provided.

Additionally, when you convert to a business profile, you'll get access to [Insights](insights.md) and [promoting posts.](promote.md)

You can find more information about business profiles at [Facebook's Business Help.](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/897631030335607/)
