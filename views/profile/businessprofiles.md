# Business Profiles

A Business Profile on Instagram will help your customers connect to your business. When converting to a Business Profile, you'll be able to include additional information about your business on your profile. For example, you'll be able to add a phone number, an email address and your business's physical address. Keep in mind that you must include at least 1 contact option.

When you add contact information, a Contact button will appear near the top of your profile. When people click that button, they'll see options like Get Directions, Call and Email, depending on the contact information you provided.

Additionally, when you convert to a Business Profile, you'll get access to [Insights](/views/profile/insights.md). These insights will help you learn more about your followers and how much your audience engages with your content. 

You can find more information about Business Profiles at [Facebook's Business Help.](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/897631030335607/)
