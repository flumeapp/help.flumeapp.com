# Business Profiles

A Business Profile on Instagram will help your customers connect to your business. When converting to a Business Profile, you'll be able to include additional information about your business on your profile. For example, you'll be able to add a phone number, an email address and your business's physical address. Keep in mind that you must include at least 1 contact option.

When you add contact information, a Contact button will appear near the top of your profile. When people click that button, they'll see options like Get Directions, Call and Email, depending on the contact information you provided.

Additionally, when you convert to a Business Profile, you'll get access to [Insights](/views/profile/insights.md). These insights will help you learn more about your followers and how much your audience engages with your content.

## Switch to a Business Profile

Only businesses on Instagram should use Business Profiles. Additionally, to get access, your business must have a Facebook Page.

> **[info]**
> You can convert your Business Profile on Instagram back to a personal account at any time.

> **[info]**
> Once you've linked a Facebook Page to your Business Profile, you'll only be able to [share](/views/upload.md#sharing) your Instagram posts to Facebook through that Page. You won't be able to share to another Facebook Page or to a Facebook profile. If you'd like to switch the Facebook Page you're able to share Instagram posts to, you'll need to convert back to a personal account. Once you've converted back, you'll then need to set up your Business Profile again and select the new Facebook Page you'd like to use.


> **[info]**
> Business Profiles can't be set to a Private Account.
