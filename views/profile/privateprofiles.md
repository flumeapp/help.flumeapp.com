# Private Profiles

Private profiles allow you to manage who can see your posts. You do not need a private profile in order to manage who can message you, as all messages from users you do not follow appear as [message requests.](/views/conversations.md#message-requests)

### Following a Private Profile

When requesting to [follow a private profile](/getstarted/follow-profile.md), the user will be notified of your [friend request.](/views/profile.md#friend-requests)

If the user accepts your friend request, you will be notified in your [Activity.](/views/activity.md) If they ignore your request, you will not receive any notification.

### Switching to a Private Profile

Do this.

_Note: [Business Profiles](/views/profile/businessprofiles.md) cannot be made private._

### Switching to a Public Profile

Do this.

_Note: All pending [friend requests](/views/profile.md#friend-requests) will be approved when switching to a public profile._
