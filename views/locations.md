Location previews are a way to quickly inspect the recent media tagged at a location without leaving your current view. These are similar to the long-press actions or 3D Touch behaviours found on the mobile Instagram apps.

To view a location preview:

- Long-press on any location name in the [Feed](//views/feed.md), or [Details.](//views/detailview.md)

To close a location preview, press the <kbd>âŽ‹ (ESC)</kbd> key, or click outside of the preview.
