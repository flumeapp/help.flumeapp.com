# Feed

The Feed view is your "Home", and displays your timeline. Depending on your [Design preferences](/preferences/design.md), the layout can differ in multiple ways.

#### Column View

This is the default setting for viewing your Feed, and displays posts from profiles you follow edge-to-edge, with no visible chrome.
