# Feed

The Feed view is your "Home", and displays your timeline. Depending on your [Design preferences](/preferences/design.md), the layout can differ in multiple ways.

#### Column View / Grid View

The Feed, as well as your [Likes](/views/likes.md) and [Profiles](/views/profile/README.md) can be viewed in either Column-View or Grid-View mode.

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;"><img src="/views/assets/feed-column.png" width="30%" height="30%" /> <img src="/views/assets/feed-grid.png" width="30%" height="30%" /></p>

To adjust your viewing mode preference:

- Use the View-Mode Switcher in the titlebar. If the titlebar is not visible, hover near the top of the main Flume window and it will appear. You can adjust your [design preferences](/preferences/design.md) to have the titlebar appear at all times.
- Use the macOS menu bar under <kbd>View > Column/Grid View</kbd>
- Use the [keyboard shortcut](/misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md) <kbd>⌥⌘1</kbd> or <kbd>⌥⌘2</kbd>

#### Column View display options

By default, Flume displays content edge-to-edge, removing distracting information and leaves you to enjoy the photos and videos as individual works of art. If you would rather view more metadata, Column-View offers 4 different levels, as explained in [design preferences](/preferences/design.md).
