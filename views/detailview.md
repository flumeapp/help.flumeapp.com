## Carousel Posts

[Carousel posts](https://help.instagram.com/269314186824048) are multiple photos and videos \(up to 10\) combined into a single post.

There are multiple methods to view a carousel post:

* Hover over the carousel post, and use the left and right cursors that appear.
* Click-and-swipe left or right with the mouse / trackpad.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each photo in a carousel post can contain different tagged users. See [Tagged Users](detailview.md#tagged-users) for more. Videos cannot contain any tagged users.
{% endhint %}
