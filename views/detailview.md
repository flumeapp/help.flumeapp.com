# Details

The Details View allows you view all information related to a post, including its caption, comments, likes, tagged location, tagged users and more.

## Carousel Posts

[Carousel posts](https://help.instagram.com/269314186824048) are multiple photos and videos \(up to 10\) combined into a single post.

There are multiple methods to view a carousel post:

* Hover over the carousel post, and use the left and right arrows that appear.
* Click-and-swipe left or right with the mouse / trackpad.
* Click the page indicator dot that appears beneath the carousel post.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each photo in a carousel post can contain different tagged users. See [Tagged Users](detailview.md#tagged-users) for more. Videos cannot contain any tagged users.
{% endhint %}

## Comments

The comments on a post are displayed by default below the caption \(if present\).

To view the comments on a post:

* Press the ⇥ \(TAB\) [keyboard shortcut.](../misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
If [comments are disabled](detailview.md#enabling--disabling-comments) on a post, the comments tab will be dimmed and disabled. If comments are [restricted](detailview.md#restricting-comments) and you do not fit the permitted commenters, you will only be able to view comments and not add or reply to existing comments.
