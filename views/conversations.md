# Conversations

The Conversations view gives you access to all the features of [Instagram Direct](https://help.instagram.com/400205900081854). You can receive [desktop notifications](/preferences/notifications.md) when new messages arrive, as conversations refresh in real-time in the background.

### Searching Conversations

If you have lots of conversations, you can quickly filter by author or group chat name using the search field (or use the <kbd>âŒ˜F</kbd> [keyboard shortcut](/misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md)) It is not currently possible to perform a full-text search of messages within each conversation, due to limitations in the Instagram API.
