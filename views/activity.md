# Activity

The Activity view shows you the latest notifications for your account. You can receive [desktop notifications](/preferences/notifications.md) when new activity arrives, as the Activity feed is automatically refreshed based on your [automatic refresh](/preferences/feed.md#automatically-refresh) setting.
