# Sharing

The Sharing window allows you to share your posts to a [linked account](profile/settings/linkedaccounts.md). If you want to share a post in a message, use the [sharing feature of conversations.](conversations/messages.md#sharing-posts)

## Sharing Posts

To share a post:

* Right-click any of your posts, then select `Share > Send to Linked Account…` from the [contextual menu.](../misc/glossary.md#contextual-menu)
* When viewing the [Details](detailview.md) of your own posts, select the `Share > Send to Linked Account…` item under the actions ![](../.gitbook/assets/actions-menu.png) button in the [title bar.](../misc/glossary.md#title-bar)
* When viewing the [Details](detailview.md) of your own posts, use the `Share > Send to Linked Account…` [Menu Bar](../misc/glossary.md#menu-bar) item.

You can provide a custom description which will accompany the shared item \(if you wish to adjust the caption, [see editing](editing.md#captions)\). Choose at least one social network to share to, and click `Share.`

The `Send to Linked Account…` item will only appear when you are sharing posts that you posted yourself.
