# Search

The Search view allows you to find specific [Profiles](/views/profile.md), [Locations](/views/locations.md) and [Hashtags](/views/hashtags.md), as well as quickly accessing previously saved search items.

### Bookmarks

When viewing a [Profile](/views/profile.md), [Location](/views/locations.md), or [Hashtag](/views/hashtags.md), you can add the item as a Bookmark, giving you quick access to it later from the Search view. 

#### Adding / removing a Bookmark

To toggle an item ([Profile](/views/profile.md), [Location](/views/locations.md), or [Hashtag](/views/hashtags.md)) as a Bookmark: 

- Click the Bookmarks icon (<img src="/views/assets/bookmark.png" width="20" height="20" />) in the title bar
- Use the <kbd>View > Add / Remove as Bookmark<kbd> menubar item.

#### Sorting Bookmarks

By default, Bookmarks are sorted in Date Added order. To change the ordering, use the "Sort byâ€¦" option under the <img src="/views/assets/settings.png" width="20" height="20" /> button.

### Suggested Searches

If you do not have any [Bookmarks](#bookmarks), the Search view will default to showing you Instagram's suggestions.

We recommend you use Flume's [Bookmarks](#bookmarks) feature to save commonly searched items, as suggested searches can change at any time based off various account-factors.

### Recent Searches

Your recent searches are populated by Instagram based off your previous searches for that account. We recommend you use Flume's [Bookmarks](#bookmarks) feature to save commonly searched items, as recent searches are limited by Instagram to just a few items.

To clear your recent searches, see [Profile](/views/profile.md).
