# Search

The Search tab allows you to find specific [Profiles](profile/), [Locations](locations.md) and [Hashtags](hashtags.md), as well as quickly accessing previously saved search items via [Search Bookmarks](search.md#search-bookmarks).

## Search Bookmarks

When viewing a [Profile](profile/), [Location](locations.md), or [Hashtag](hashtags.md), you can add the item as a Bookmark, giving you quick access to it later from the Search view.

### Importing / Exporting Search Bookmarks

To import or export your Bookmarks, use the `Import / Export Bookmarks…` option under the ![](../.gitbook/assets/settings.png) button in the title bar, or under the `File > Bookmarks` `Menu Bar` item.

## Suggested Searches

If you do not have any [Bookmarks](search.md#bookmarks), the Search view will default to showing you Instagram's suggestions.

We recommend you use Flume's [Bookmarks](search.md#bookmarks) feature to save commonly searched items, as suggested searches can change at any time based off various account-factors.

To remove a suggested search:

* Click the delete ![](../.gitbook/assets/delete.png) button next to the suggested user, hashtag, or place you wish to remove.
* Right-click on a suggested user, hashtag, or place and select `Hide` from the [contextual menu.](../misc/glossary.md#contextual-menu)

## Recent Searches

Your recent searches are populated by Instagram based off your previous searches for that account. We recommend you use Flume's [Bookmarks](search.md#bookmarks) feature to save commonly searched items, as recent searches are limited by Instagram to just a few items.

To clear your recent searches, see [Profile Settings.](profile/settings/)

## Nearby Location Searches

To search locations that are near to you:

* Click the `Places` search type tab.
* If you have previously searched for a term, press the clear ![](../.gitbook/assets/clear.png) button to remove the current search term.
* Click the `Nearby Places` row in the list of results.
