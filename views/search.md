# Search

The Search tab allows you to find specific [Profiles](/views/profile.md), [Locations](/views/locations.md) and [Hashtags](/views/hashtags.md), as well as quickly accessing previously saved search items via [Search Bookmarks](#search-bookmarks).

## Search Bookmarks

When viewing a [Profile](/views/profile.md), [Location](/views/locations.md), or [Hashtag](/views/hashtags.md), you can add the item as a Bookmark, giving you quick access to it later from the Search view.

- Click the bookmarks <img src="/views/assets/bookmark.png" width="20" height="20" /> button in the title bar when viewing the details of a [Profile](/views/profile.md), [Location](/views/locations.md), or [Hashtag.](/views/hashtags.md)

### Importing / Exporting Search Bookmarks

To import or export your Bookmarks, use the <kbd>Import / Export Bookmarks…</kbd> option under the <img src="/views/assets/settings.png" width="20" height="20" /> button in the title bar, or under the <kbd>File > Bookmarks</kbd> Menu Bar item.

## Suggested Searches

If you do not have any [Bookmarks](#bookmarks), the Search view will default to showing you Instagram's suggestions.

We recommend you use Flume's [Bookmarks](#bookmarks) feature to save commonly searched items, as suggested searches can change at any time based off various account-factors.

To remove a suggested search:

- Click the delete <img src="/views/assets/delete.png" width="20" height="20" /> button next to the suggested user, hashtag, or place you wish to remove.
- Right-click on a suggested user, hashtag, or place and select <kbd>Hide</kbd> from the contextual menu.

------

## Recent Searches

Your recent searches are populated by Instagram based off your previous searches for that account. We recommend you use Flume's [Bookmarks](#bookmarks) feature to save commonly searched items, as recent searches are limited by Instagram to just a few items.

To clear your recent searches, see [Profile Settings.](/views/profile/settings.md)
