# Search

The Search tab allows you to find specific [Profiles](/views/profile.md), [Locations](/views/locations.md) and [Hashtags](/views/hashtags.md), as well as quickly accessing previously saved search items via [Search Bookmarks](#search-bookmarks).

## Search Bookmarks

When viewing a [Profile](/views/profile.md), [Location](/views/locations.md), or [Hashtag](/views/hashtags.md), you can add the item as a Bookmark, giving you quick access to it later from the Search view.

### Adding / Removing Search Bookmarks

To toggle an item ([Profile](/views/profile.md), [Location](/views/locations.md), or [Hashtag](/views/hashtags.md)) as a Bookmark, perform one of the following: 

- Click the Bookmarks icon <img src="/views/assets/bookmark.png" width="20" height="20" /> in the title bar when viewing the details of a [Profile](/views/profile.md), [Location](/views/locations.md), or [Hashtag.](/views/hashtags.md)

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;"><img src="/views/assets/bookmark-toggle.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>


- Use the <kbd>View > Add / Remove "ITEM" to Bookmarks</kbd> macOS Menu Bar item.
- When viewing your list of Bookmarks, click the <img src="/views/assets/actions-dismiss.png" width="20" height="20" /> button.

## Suggested Searches

If you do not have any [Bookmarks](#bookmarks), the Search view will default to showing you Instagram's suggestions.

We recommend you use Flume's [Bookmarks](#bookmarks) feature to save commonly searched items, as suggested searches can change at any time based off various account-factors.

<hr />

## Recent Searches

Your recent searches are populated by Instagram based off your previous searches for that account. We recommend you use Flume's [Bookmarks](#bookmarks) feature to save commonly searched items, as recent searches are limited by Instagram to just a few items.

To clear your recent searches, see [Profile.](/views/profile.md)
