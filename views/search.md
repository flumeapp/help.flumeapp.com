# Search

The Search view allows you to find specific [Profiles](/views/profile.md), [Locations](/views/locations.md) and [Hashtags](/views/hashtags.md), as well as quickly accessing previously saved search items.

### Bookmarks

When viewing a [Profile](/views/profile.md), [Location](/views/locations.md), or [Hashtag](/views/hashtags.md), you can add the item as a Bookmark, giving you quick access to it later from the Search view. 

To add an item as a bookmark:

- Click the bookmarks icon (<img src="/views/assets/bookmark.png" width="20" height="20" />) in the title bar
- Use the <kbd>View > Add to Bookmarks<kbd> menubar item.

### Suggested Searches

### Recent Searches

Your recent searches are populated by Instagram based off previous searches. We recommend you use Flume's [Bookmarks](#bookmarks) feature as a better replacement since recent searches are limited to just a few items.

To clear your recent searches, see [Profile](/views/profile.md).
