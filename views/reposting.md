# Reposting

The reposting window allows you to [upload](upload.md) existing posts \(from you or other profiles\) by ensuring the original author is attributed.

## Reposting Posts

To repost a post:

* Right-click any post, then select `Repost [Photo|Video|Carousel Post]…` from the [contextual menu.](../misc/glossary.md#contextual-menu)
* When viewing the [details](detailview.md) of a post, select the `Repost [Photo|Video|Carousel Post]…` item under the actions ![](../.gitbook/assets/actions-menu.png) button in the [title bar.](../misc/glossary.md#title-bar)
* Use the `Post > Repost [Photo|Video|Carousel Post]…` [menu bar](../misc/glossary.md#menu-bar) item when selecting a post via [keyboard navigation](../misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md) or viewing the [details](detailview.md) of a post.

{% hint style="info" %}
The repost menu items are hidden for posts that were made by a profile that is marked as private. An exception exists if the private profile is added as an account in Flume.
{% endhint %}

## Repost Settings

When reposting a post, you can adjust a few settings. If you are reposting a post from a profile that you have logged in with, you will be able to also make editing adjustments and choose a filter. When you are reposting content that you did not create, or do not have source access to, the adjustments and filter settings will not be displayed.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are reposting content from a profile that is not added as an account in Flume you **must** choose at least one method of author attribution \(see below\).
{% endhint %}

### Banner

This attribution option adds a small banner which includes the original author's avatar image and their username. The banner position \(including off\) and banner background colour can be customised.

### Include original caption

The caption that the author originally used is appended to the end of your repost caption. This does not remove the `#repost @username` text. If you wish to remove this text, you must do so manually, however one of the other author attribution methods must be used.

### Tag author

The original author of the post is tagged into the post, in the center of the post. To adjust the position of the tag, see [tagging users.](upload.md#tagged-users)

{% hint style="info" %}
Flume does not currently support tagging users in videos. As a result, reposting video content will disable the option to tag the original author.
