# Info

The Conversation Info view lists all the members of a conversation and allows you to view and edit members of a group conversation as well as perform actions related to a conversation.

## Naming Group Conversations

By default, a group conversation will be given the name of every member in the group. You can give a group conversation a custom name \([up to 20 characters](../../misc/limits.md)\) if you prefer.

To rename a group conversation:

* Type a group name where the placeholder `Group name…` appears, or replace the existing name, and press `↩ (ENTER/RETURN)` to confirm.

{% hint style="info" %}
One-on-one conversations cannot be named.
{% endhint %}

## Adding Members to Group Conversations

You can include up to [15 users](../../misc/limits.md) in a group conversation.

To add a new member to a group conversation:

* Click the `Add People…` item. Use the search field to find a specific user, or select from the suggestions that appear using the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/select.png) button. To confirm your selections, click the Confirm ![](../../.gitbook/assets/accept.png) button.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can only add users to existing group conversations. It is not possible to add members to a one-on-one conversation.
{% endhint %}

## Removing Members to Group Conversations

It is not possible to remove a user from a group conversation. If necessary, you can [block a user.](../profile/settings/blockedusers.md)
