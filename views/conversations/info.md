### Naming Group Conversations

By default, a group conversation will be given the name of every member in the group. 

To rename a group conversation:

- Type a group name where the placeholder "Group name…". A [limit of 20 characters](/misc/limits.md) applies and press <kbd>ENTER/RETURN</kbd> to confirm.

_Note: One-on-one conversations cannot be named, and it is not possible to rename a group that already has a name._

### Adding Members to Group Conversations

You can include up to [15 users](/misc/limits.md) in a group conversation.

Use the search field to find a specific user, or select from the suggestions that appear using the <img src="/views/assets/select.png" width="20" height="20" /> button. To confirm your selections, click the Confirm <img src="/views/assets/accept.png" width="20" height="20" /> button.
