## Naming Group Conversations

By default, a group conversation will be given the name of every member in the group. You can give a group conversation a custom name ([up to 20 characters](/misc/limits.md)) if you prefer.

To rename a group conversation:

- Type a group name where the placeholder "Group name…" appears, or replace the existing name, and press <kbd>ENTER/RETURN</kbd> to confirm.

> **[info]**
> One-on-one conversations cannot be named.

## Adding Members to Group Conversations

You can include up to [15 users](/misc/limits.md) in a group conversation.

Use the search field to find a specific user, or select from the suggestions that appear using the <img src="/views/assets/select.png" width="20" height="20" /> button.
