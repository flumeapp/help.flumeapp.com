### Writing Messages / Replies

There are many ways to begin a conversation with a user, however you should note that if the recipient of a message does not [follow](/getstarted/follow-profile.md) you, your message will not appear in their inbox directly but as a [message request](/views/conversations/list.md#message-requests) that they must approve or decline.

To write a new message:

- From the [Conversations List](/views/conversations/list.md) view, click the compose <img src="/views/assets/compose.png" width="20" height="20" /> button. Use the search field to find a specific user, or select from the suggestions that appear. If you select multiple users, a group conversation will be created.

- When viewing the [Profile](/views/profile.md) of a user, use the <kbd>Send Message</kbd> option under the <img src="/views/assets/actions-menu.png" width="20" height="20" /> button.

To reply to messages:

- Select the conversation from the [conversations list.](/views/conversations/list.md)
