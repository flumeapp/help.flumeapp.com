### Writing Messages / Replies

There are many ways to begin a conversation with a user, however you should note that if the recipient of a message does not [follow](/getstarted/follow-profile.md) you, your message will not appear in their inbox directly but as a [message request](/views/conversations/list.md#message-requests) that they must approve or decline.

See [Creating Conversations](/views/conversations/list.md#creating-conversations) for creating a new conversation.

To reply to messages:

- Select the conversation from the [conversations list.](/views/conversations/list.md)
