### Creating Conversations

To create a new conversation, click the button in the title bar. A list of suggested recipients will appear, and you can search for specific profiles. Selecting more than one recipient will create a group conversation ([maximum of 15 recipients](/misc/limits.md)).

<hr />

### Deleting Conversations

Deleting a conversation will only remove the conversation from your own inbox, but will not remove it from the inbox of other recipients. 

To delete a conversation:

- Right-click a conversation, then select <kdb>Delete Conversation…</kdb> from the contextual menu.
- When selecting a conversation using the [keyboard arrows](/misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md), use the <kbd>Conversation > Delete Conversation…</kbd> macOS Menu Bar item.
- When viewing the conversation's [messages](/views/conversations/messages.md), use the <kbd>Delete Conversation…</kbd> option under the <img src="/views/assets/actions-menu.png" width="20" height="20" /> button.

You will be asked to confirm the deletion.

### Leaving Group Conversations

Leaving a group conversation will stop you from receiving any further messages in the group, though it will not remove your previous messages sent in the group. The other members of the group conversation will be made aware that you left the group conversation. You can be added back to a group if you have not [blocked the users](/views/profile/blockedusers.md) in the group.

If you would prefer to remain in the group, but disable notifications of new messages, you can [mute the conversation](#muting-conversations) instead.

To leave a group conversation:

- Right-click a conversation, then select <kdb>Leave Conversation…</kdb> from the contextual menu.
- When selecting a conversation using the [keyboard arrows](/misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md), use the <kbd>Conversation > Leave Conversation…</kbd> macOS Menu Bar item.
- When viewing the conversation's [messages](/views/conversations/messages.md), use the <kbd>Leave Conversation…</kbd> option under the <img src="/views/assets/actions-menu.png" width="20" height="20" /> button.

You will be asked to confirm leaving the group.

<hr />

### Muting Conversations

Muted conversations will not send [desktop notifications](/preferences/notifications.md) when new messages are received, and also disable push notifications to your mobile devices if enabled.

To mute/un-mute a conversation:

- Right-click a conversation, then select <kdb>Mute/Unmute Conversation</kdb> from the contextual menu.
- When selecting a conversation using the [keyboard arrows](/misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md), use the <kbd>Conversation > Mute/Unmute Conversation</kbd> macOS Menu Bar item.
- When viewing the conversation's [messages](/views/conversations/messages.md), use the <kbd>Mute/Unmute Conversation</kbd> option under the <img src="/views/assets/actions-menu.png" width="20" height="20" /> button.

Muted conversations will display a small icon to indicate their current mute status.

### Reporting / Blocking Conversations

To report a conversation:

<hr />

### Message Requests

When a user that you do not follow sends you a message, their message will not appear immediately in your inbox, but requires approval. When you have open message requests, an indicator will appear above the list of conversations.

### Searching Conversations

If you have lots of conversations, you can quickly filter by author or group chat name using the search field (or use the <kbd>⌘F</kbd> [keyboard shortcut](/misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md)) It is not currently possible to perform a full-text search of messages within each conversation, due to limitations in the Instagram API.

<hr />

To toggle a conversation as a Bookmark, perform one of the following: 

- Click the Bookmarks icon (<img src="/views/assets/bookmark.png" width="20" height="20" />) in the title bar when viewing the details of a Conversation.
