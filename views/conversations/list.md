## Creating Conversations

There are many ways to begin a conversation with a user, however you should note that if the recipient of a message does not follow you, your message will not appear in their inbox directly but as a [message request](list.md#message-requests) that they must approve or decline.

To create a new conversation from the conversations list:

* Click the compose ![](../../.gitbook/assets/compose%20%281%29.png) button in the [title bar. ](../../misc/glossary.md#title-bar)
* Tap the `New` ![](../../.gitbook/assets/compose.png) button in the [Touch Bar.](../../misc/touchbar.md)

A list of suggested recipients will appear, and you can search for specific profiles. Selecting more than one recipient will create a group conversation \([maximum of 30 recipients](../../misc/limits.md)\).

After making a selection, the confirm button and compose area will appear, allowing you to write your message or [share a photo/video.](messages.md#sharing-photos-videos)

You can also create conversations directly from the [profile](../profile/) of a user.

To create a new conversation from the profile of a user:

* Use the `Send Message` option under the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/actions-menu%20%284%29.png) button in the [title bar.](../../misc/glossary.md#title-bar)
* Tap the `Message` ![](../../.gitbook/assets/message.png) button in the [Touch Bar.](../../misc/touchbar.md)

## Deleting Conversations

Deleting a conversation will only remove the conversation from your own inbox, but will not remove it from the inbox of other recipients.

To delete a conversation:

* Right-click a conversation, then select `Delete Conversation…` from the contextual menu.
* When selecting a conversation using [keyboard navigation](../../misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md), use the `Conversation > Delete Conversation…` [menu bar](../../misc/glossary.md#menu-bar) item.
* When viewing the conversation's [messages](messages.md), use the `Delete Conversation…` option under the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/actions-menu.png) button.
* Tap the `Delete` ![](../../.gitbook/assets/delete.png) button in the [Touch Bar.](../../misc/touchbar.md)

You will be asked to confirm the deletion.

## Leaving Group Conversations

Leaving a group conversation will stop you from receiving any further messages in the group, though it will not remove your previous messages sent in the group. The other members of the group conversation will be made aware that you left the group conversation. You can be added back to a group if you have not [blocked the users](../profile/settings/blockedusers.md) in the group.

If you would prefer to remain in the group, but disable notifications of new messages, you can [mute the conversation](list.md#muting-conversations) instead.

To leave a group conversation:

* Right-click a conversation, then select `Leave Conversation…` from the [contextual menu.](../../misc/glossary.md#contextual-menu)
* When selecting a conversation using [keyboard navigation](../../misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md), use the `Conversation > Leave Conversation…` [menu bar](../../misc/glossary.md#menu-bar) item.
* When viewing the conversation's [messages](messages.md), use the `Leave Conversation…` option under the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/actions-menu%20%283%29.png) button.
* When viewing the conversation's [info](info.md), click the `Leave` ![](../../.gitbook/assets/leave%20%281%29.png) button in the [title bar.](../../misc/glossary.md#title-bar)
* Tap the `Leave` ![](../../.gitbook/assets/leave.png) button in the [Touch Bar.](../../misc/touchbar.md)

You will be asked to confirm leaving the group.

## Muting Conversations

Muted conversations will not send [desktop notifications](../../preferences/notifications.md) when new messages are received, and also disable push notifications to your mobile devices if enabled.

To mute/un-mute a conversation:

* Right-click a conversation, then select `Mute/Unmute Conversation` from the [contextual menu.](../../misc/glossary.md#contextual-menu)
* When selecting a conversation using [keyboard navigation](../../misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md), use the `Conversation > Mute/Unmute Conversation` [menu bar](../../misc/glossary.md#menu-bar) item.
* When viewing the conversation's [messages](messages.md), use the `Mute/Unmute Conversation` option under the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/actions-menu%20%281%29.png) button in the [title bar.](../../misc/glossary.md#title-bar)
* Tap the `Mute` ![](../../.gitbook/assets/mute.png) or `Unmute` ![](../../.gitbook/assets/mute-active.png) button in the [Touch Bar.](../../misc/touchbar.md)

Muted conversations will display a small icon to indicate their current mute status.

## Message Requests

When a user that you do not follow sends you a message, their message will not appear immediately in your inbox, but requires approval. When you have open message requests, an indicator will appear above the list of conversations.

## Searching Conversations

If you have lots of conversations, you can quickly filter by author or group chat name using the search field \(or use the `⌘F` [keyboard shortcut](../../misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md)\) It is not currently possible to perform a full-text search of messages within each conversation, due to limitations in the Instagram API.

* Click the `Bookmarks` ![](../../.gitbook/assets/bookmark.png)button in the [title bar](../../misc/glossary.md#title-bar) when viewing the [messages](messages.md) of a conversation.
