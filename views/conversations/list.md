### Search Conversations

If you have lots of conversations, you can quickly filter by author or group chat name using the search field (or use the <kbd>⌘F</kbd> [keyboard shortcut](/misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md)) It is not currently possible to perform a full-text search of messages within each conversation, due to limitations in the Instagram API.
