# Conversations

The conversations view gives you access to all the features of [Instagram Direct.](https://help.instagram.com/400205900081854) You can receive [desktop notifications](../../preferences/notifications.md) when new messages arrive, as conversations refresh in real-time in the background.

If [Push Notifications](../../preferences/notifications.md) are enabled to be always received, new message requests and messages can be received even when Flume is not running.
