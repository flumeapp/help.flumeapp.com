Notifications in Flume can occur in the following ways:

** Badge the Dock icon ** - A red indicator will display on the Dock icon.

** Show a desktop notification ** - A macOS desktop notification will appear, with actionable items (eg. to reply to a new message, or to view a new activity notification).

** Play an audio alert ** - A short audio sound effect will play. The volume will be set to the current [macOS alert volume](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18959).

#### New Posts

Whenever the Flume window is not front-most, and new content in the [Feed](/views/feed.md) is downloaded, the notification settings will apply. This usually occurs when the [automatic refresh interval](/preferences/feed.md#automatic-refresh-interval) elapses.

#### New Activity

Whenever there is new content on the [Activity](/views/activity.md) tab, the selected notification settings will apply. New activity types include new likes and comments on your posts, mentions of your username in comments, updated spam reports from Instagram, new friends/contacts that have joined Instagram, copyright breaches and potentially future notification types that Instagram may add in the future. This usually occurs when the [automatic refresh interval](/preferences/feed.md#automatic-refresh-interval) elapses.

#### New Messages

Whenever a new message in an existing [Conversation](/views/conversations.md) is received, or a user you follow messages you for the first time, the notification settings will apply. Messages are received in real-time and thus do not depend on the [automatic refresh interval](/preferences/feed.md#automatic-refresh-interval) setting.

#### Follower Requests

Whenever a new follower request is received, the notification settings will apply. This usually occurs when the [automatic refresh interval](/preferences/feed.md#automatic-refresh-interval) elapses. 

_Applies only to [private profiles](/views/profile/privateprofiles.md)_.
