# Hidden Users

## Hidden Users

Flume has the unique ability to hide users posts from your [Feed](../../views/feed.md), without specifically unfollowing that user. The feature essentially allows you to temporarily \(or permanently\) mute a user that you follow, for instance if they post too regularly.

## Adding a Hidden User

To hide a user's posts:

* When viewing the post of a user in your [Feed](../../views/feed.md), right-click their post, then select the Hide posts from @username from the contextual menu.

## Removing a Hidden User

To unhide a user:

* Click the delete ![](../../.gitbook/assets/delete.png) button next to the user you wish to unhide.
