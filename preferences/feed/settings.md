# Settings

## Automatically Refresh

Choose a refresh interval to automatically refresh your [Feed](../../views/feed.md), [Activity](../../views/activity.md), [Conversations](../../views/conversations/) and [Notifications](../notifications.md) badge when Flume is open. Note that the Flume window does not need to be visible, but you must be [logged in](../../views/login.md) to an account.

If using Flume with [multiple accounts](../accounts.md#adding-an-account-), the refresh will only occur for the currently active account.

## Hide

Enable or disable displaying photos or videos in Flume. When enabled, all photos or videos will be filtered from the [Feed](../../views/feed.md), [Likes](../../views/likes.md) and [Explore](../../views/explore.md) views. Photo or videos will still be displayed on [Profiles.](../../views/profile/)

## Use Relative Dates

Will toggle the display of dates for posts between relative \(`2 hours ago`\), or absolute \(`Saturday, April 1st, 2017 13:37`\). The exact format of absolute dates will depend on your [macOS Language & Region](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18445) preferences.

## Automatically Scroll to Top

Enable or disable fixing the scroll position to the first item \(top\) whenever an [automatic refresh](settings.md#automatically-refresh) triggers, or when [manually refreshing.](../../misc/keyboard-shortcuts.md). This option only applies when viewing the [Feed](../../views/feed.md) in Column-View mode.

## Selecting Posts in Feed

Customize the action that will occur when clicking on posts in the [Feed.](https://github.com/flumeapp/help.flumeapp.com/tree/1577f0ffdac2f11d862e55096c48747d3c60ea48/views/Feed.md)

| `Shows Author` | Clicking on a post will "push" you to see the author's [Profile.](../../views/profile/) |
