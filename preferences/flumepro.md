Flume Pro is a one-time [In-App Purchase](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202023), our way of sustaining the development of Flume. You can read more about the introduction of Flume Pro on our [blog.](http://blog.flumeapp.com/post/145212126271/introducing-flume-20-and-flume-pro)

Features that are unlocked via Flume Pro display a <img src="/preferences/assets/pro.png" width="36" height="20" /> badge.

Benefits of Flume Pro:

- [Upload photos/videos.](/views/upload.md)
- [Add multiple accounts.](/preferences/accounts.md) You can add and easily switch between as many accounts as you like.
- A good feeling :)

Flume for Mac via [Setapp](https://go.setapp.com/stp154) includes Flume Pro as standard and does not require any additional upgrade purchase, as it is covered by Setapp's monthly subscription fee.

## Upgrading to Flume Pro

To upgrade to Flume Pro, simply open Flume's [Preferences](/preferences/README.md), click on the "Flume Pro" tab, then click on "Upgrade to Pro". The price of Flume Pro will vary based on your App Store region and currency, and will be displayed in the button.

Flume will communicate with the App Store to confirm your Apple ID and purchase. Upon a successful purchase, you will be presented with a thank you screen. All previously locked features such as [uploading](/views/upload.md) and [adding multiple accounts](/preferences/accounts.md) will be unlocked and the <img src="/preferences/assets/pro.png" width="36" height="20" /> badge will disappear.
