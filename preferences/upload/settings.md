## Photo Quality Level

Depending on the type of content you post to Instagram, you can speed up upload and download times by adjusting the image compression levels that are applied to your photos prior to upload.

For high resolution and high DPI photography, we recommend an 80% quality level which will result in minimal loss of image quality, while resulting in faster uploads and downloads.

If you mostly post lower resolution, and 72-DPI photos, we recommend a quality level between 80-100%.

## Automatically Set Location

When enabled and your photo or video contains EXIF GPS data, Flume will perform a background search for locations, and automatically set the first result that Instagram returns.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that you cannot tag GPS coordinates on Instagram, only Facebook Places. To add new locations, [you must create a Facebook Place.](https://help.instagram.com/1618893218361276)
{% endhint %}

## Pre-fill Caption

Flume allows you to create your own customised caption, that can be populated using EXIF or IPTC information embedded in your photos and videos, or any text you wish \(eg. lists of hashtags\). 

{% hint style="info" %}
The [IPTC Photo Metadata Standard](https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/iptc-standard/) is the most widely used standard to describe photos. When adding metadata information with Photos.app, Adobe Lightroom, Capture One Pro and other popular photo-editing/cataloging software.
