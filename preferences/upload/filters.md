#### Photo Quality Level

Depending on the type of content you post to Instagram, you can speed up upload and download times by adjusting the image compression levels that are applied to your photos prior to upload.

For high resolution and high DPI photography, we recommend an 80% quality level which will result in minimal loss of image quality, while resulting in faster uploads and downloads. 

If you mostly post lower resolution, and 72-DPI photos, we recommend a quality level between 80-100%.
