Enables or disables showing the Flume title bar in [Feed](../views/feed.md) and [Likes.](../views/likes.md) When disabled, [Show the menu](design.md#show-the-menu) is set to `On Hover` and [Show media details](design.md#show-media-details) is set to `None`, Flume will display content edge-to-edge with no visible chrome \(_default_\).

## Show Post Details

Customizes the amount of details to show about media when in Column-View content areas \([Feed](../views/feed.md), [Likes](../views/likes.md) and [Profile.](../views/profile/)\) See [Feed](../views/feed.md) for visual examples.

| Option | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| `None` | Does not display any additional information about posts \(_default_\). |
| `All` | Displays the author, location \(if applicable\), caption, timestamp, and buttons to like, comment, share and save the post. This option resembles the official Instagram application. |
| `Compact` | Displays the author, location \(if applicable\) and the posting date. |
| `On Hover` | Displays the author, location \(if applicable\) and posting date, overlaid on the post when the mouse hovers directly above. When the mouse exits, the details are hidden. |
