##### Language

Flume supports the following languages: Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.

Adjusting the language will adjust all user-interface elements, as well as content that is returned from Instagram directly, such as the language of [activity notifications](/views/activity.md), and error messages.

Note that you will need to restart Flume after changing language in order for it to take effect.

##### Show icon in

Choose between three options:

- Dock only
- Dock and menu bar
- Menu bar only

If set to "Menu bar only", it is a macOS feature that the macOS menubar will not update when Flume is in focus. To access Flume's preferences again, right-click on Flume's menubar icon.
