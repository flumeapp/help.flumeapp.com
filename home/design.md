# Design

The saying goes that a picture is worth a thousand words, and one of Flume's unique features is its standout layout and design, presenting content by default edge-to-edge, with no visible menu bar or title area.

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;"><img src="/home/assets/design.png" width="60%" height="60%" /></p>

Flume lets you also customize your viewing preferences to your own preferences. Learn more in [Design Preferences](/preferences/design.md).
